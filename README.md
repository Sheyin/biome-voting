# Biome Voting App

This was designed for use within the New Blocks server.  People can freely 'register' and vote/comment on each listed biome, and decide whether or not the community wants this to appear in the next season's server (Minecraft).  Results are updated and reflected on each page under 'Statistics'.

# Privacy
The votes are anonymized - while they are tracked by user, I don't look at that section at all (scout's honor), and instead look at the anonymized votes per biome.  Also, people are free to choose any nickname they want to keep their votes secret.  No other information is collected (that I am aware of).

# Usage
On the live site, (link is in Discord only) enter a username/nickname to begin, and then you'll be taken to a page with a picture and description of a biome (ex. the Alps).  There are buttons to give it a thumbs up/thumbs down, or a maybe vote - or you can simply abstain and skip to the next page by using the next button towards the bottom.  If you want to go back to a section, there is a pull-out side navigation which lists all ~100 or so biomes to vote on.  You can also go back and change your vote at any time.  You can leave comments at the bottom of each biome page - may need to scroll down a bit to see it.
